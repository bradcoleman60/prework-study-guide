Prework study guide for Cal Berkeley Boot Camp


## Summary

- This website provides notes and information on the 3 main coding langauges that are used to create websites - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  It also provides information and notes on the GIT - the versioning tool that is used to ensure that we have proper version control over the coding files that comprise the website. I created this website to provide this useful information to my fellow bootcamp members as we start this new journey. During this project I learned a great deal of how a webiste in created and the purpose and use of each distinct coding langauge.  I also found this project useful in practicing the GIT and Git Hub workflow process (Pull, Commit, Add and Merge).
